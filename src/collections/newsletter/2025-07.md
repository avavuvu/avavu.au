    - title: Converting any data into sound and image
      info: Sonification is not anything new, but I really loved this convertion of the raw data of Microsoft Paint into audio and video, there's a real musicality to it. I also found this online tool that will convert anything you throw at into an mp4.

music:
    - title: EGOISM – And Go Nowhere
      info: I love a band that sings through their natural accent. This is an incredibly charming little album from a incredibly charming little band from Sydney. They sound like early The 1975, in the way they are trying hard to seem like they are not trying very hard.

    - title: Life Without Buildings
      info: My friend recommended this Scottish band to me after I sang-rapped on demo of a song we were recording. He compared me to the lead singer of this band, who he compared to a pixie dancing on stage.

    - title: GEESE - Taxes
      info: I recently discovered GEESE – the band that Cameron Winter shot off from – and I am in love. They have a new album out soon and I love this single.

# Hi! And welcome to my newsletter. 

This is the place you’ll find all of this month’s Ava Vu news. Regretably, there is only so much Ava Vu news, so this monthly email will mostly be filled with things for you. That’ll include a curated list of curious web things, music recommendations, and more, as well as my thoughts and feelings about said things. 

## The News


## How this email found you
Hi! I hope this email found you well, I thought I should write a little something for the technical freaks who want to know just exactly how this email found you. There was a sensible way of starting a newsletter, which was using one of the many mailing list services that exist, but I thought that would be too expensive. In that case, the next best thing would be self hosting an open source mailing service on a webserver. That would be too boring. This email was beamed to you through AWS’s Simple Emailing Service (SES), via some Rust code hosted on AWS Lambda, while all your contact information is on an DynamoDB database. Aside from a brief run-in with Rust, I had not used any of those technologies before starting this project. To say that it’s a miracle that this email found you at all is an understatement. The code I created is hobbler together with nuts, bolts, and willpower. Although the virtue of writing anything in Rust, even something as poorly designed as this, is its. Going from Javascript to Rust is like going from a sauna to an ice bath, a metaphor that's apt given neither experience feels straightforwardly pleasant. 

Here’s my current workflow:

<!-- class="workflow" -->
- Google Docs
- Pasted into Markdown file
- Uploaded to my website
- Bash script -> AWS Lambda function to download Markdown
- Rust generates HTML, Uploads template to AWS SES
- Bash script -> AWS Lambda function to send emails     	
- The email finds you! (hopefully)


You might notice something strange in this workflow: Rust is generating the HTML, rather than my front end website. That's right, we are writing front-end code in Rust using the Maud HTML library and the black magic of proc macros. 


## Spotlight
I wanted to write a short piece about a new YouTuber I’ve completely fallen in love with: [Tor’s Cabinet of Curiosities](https://www.youtube.com/@torscabinetofcuriosities/videos). He makes long form explainers of curious things he’s encountered. That seems like a tried and true YouTube format, for which a write up would be unnecessary, and that would be the case but Tor Parson’s YouTube channel requires a little bit more buy-in than the average video essayist type. After a pithy intro, every episode includes an introduction of himself, Tor Parsons, as well as his co-hosts: most weeks being Thimble, an upright porcelain doll on his left; and Jollibee on his right, a creepy faced durian. These characters don’t speak, and after the introduction they are very rarely referenced, but there they are, in every shot that cuts back to Tor at his desk. 

I love this. It feels like you’re entering into a TV show at episode 3. This, combined with some strange set design and an overlong intro, make his videos are very un-YouTuber-y, which feels genuinely refreshing in the ultra congested YouTube landscape of 2025. Which is especially nice to see from someone like me, who tried and failed last year to start a YouTube channel by playing the YouTube game. As a viewer I was able to look past, and even learn to love, Tor’s quirky presentation style because I find his writing and story telling so engaging. He’s able to weave personal anecdotes in with heady subject matter in a way that feels effortless.

It also helps that a lot of my personal fascinations line up with his video topics. Big topics like [elections](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwRPqnxuOPo), [China](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0eUz0juTRw), [technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JHVW2dcExA), [trains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzBnlM22O5E), and [the Beach boys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McqTMvpoxGk). Or benign mysteries like [how one of the most translated Wikipedia articles is High School Musical star Corbin Bleu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJ_pEP3fRvM), or [how so many Chinese Santa Claus statues are playing the saxophone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlRpMrHPT8s). If any of that interests you, please give his videos a try.
