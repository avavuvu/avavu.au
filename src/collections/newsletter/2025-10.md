    - title: Cornflake bag
      info: This is what it would be like if you were really little and in a bag of cornflakes.

    - title: Big Joel ‚Äì You Are Into Mousetrap YouTube 
      info: I liked this animated short a lot. It feels rare to have my reality reflected back to me, not that I am into Mousetrap YouTube. More so my constant internet media consumption. That reflection was one of the few good parts of Eddington. I think I gave that movie one star on Letterboxd but I keep thinking about it so maybe I should bump it up to two.

    - title: Analog Princess ‚Äì Analog Princess Slime Time Experience
      info: I discovered this YouTube channel composed of very surreal FL Studio tutorials. It is probably one of the only instances of artistic generative AI that I‚Äôve ever seen.

music:
    - title: Smerz ‚Äì You got time and I got money
      info: 'This might be the most romantic song I‚Äôve ever heard: ‚ÄúBaby, can I see you naked? (Please?) Even though I love how you dress‚Äù. It has the best quality of Dijon‚Äôs music, where everything feels slapdash but also carefully constructed. I hadn‚Äôt heard of Smerz before this song popped up on my YouTube, but I see a NewJeans production credit on their Wikipedia. I suspect they could make ultra processed K-Pop if they felt like it.'

    - title: Monolake ‚Äì Hongkong
      info: A lot of my writing this month has been done listening to this album. I don‚Äôt like listening to music when I work, because it‚Äôs just way too distracting. That‚Äôll give you a clue of the brown noise quality of this record.

    - title: SIX IMPALA ‚Äì HEELSTOMPER
      info: Six Impala is (I think) one of the side projects of Underscores. This song is pretty weird and cool. She also releases freaky remixes as MILKFISH.

    - title: Capacity with underscores b2b umru @TheLotRadio 05-24-2025 
      info: Also listen to this DJ Set with umru and Underscores. It‚Äôs really fun

# Hello {{name}}!

Simply called ‚Äúdistorted face‚Äù, I think the Unicode consortium have outdone themself. This new emoji might be the most important invention in communication since the Sumerians first pressed styluses into wet clay. It will fill the gap currently left between üò≥and ü§™and ü§Ø. [Google has just rolled out their design](https://emojipedia.org/distorted-face?ref=blog.emojipedia.org#designs), and I suspect Apple will follow suit, given the presumably rapturous demand.

## Hyperpop
My self-imposed challenge of writing one essay a month is still unbroken, as I hit upload on my essay on Hyperpop at 11:20pm last night. This one manages to be even more ambitious than the first, hitting 4,200 words and requiring me to rewrite the code that displays my essays to accommodate the load of the multimedia. Future essays will be shorter I promise, either that or I am going to miss the next deadline. There is a secret third option, where the essays keep getting longer, and released on time, but I go completely crazy doing it. It‚Äôs an idea.

This essay is about Hyperpop, a topic near and dear to my heart, that I feel hasn‚Äôt gotten the retrospective it deserves. Last month I said the essay would be about websites or AI writing, but I think before I can write anything new, I need to get the backlog out of my head. Much like the coffee essay, this topic has been on my mind for ages. I kept trying to reconfigure it with different framing devices and openers, but I found that grounding it in my disappointment about 10,000 gecs made the most sense. It‚Äôs usually easier to pick a small topic and expand out, than try and start big and hone in.

I mention it in one of the margin notes, but I really think you should read [A.G. Cook‚Äôs eulogy for SOPHIE](https://agcook.com/msmsmsm/). Her death was the first time a celebrity passing ever really got to me. I remember when Google made a corny Google Doodle to commemorate her it made me cry. Of course, what A.G. Cook wrote is very sad but it‚Äôs also very uplifting. It will hopefully inspire you to create in the same way it inspired me. He mentions how SOPHIE would say to ‚Äúphoenix that shit‚Äù, when you just need to tear everything down and start again, rather than trying to tweak something to death. I‚Äôve held that mantra dear ever since I read it.

## All Purple
I‚Äôve been working on my own version of the NYT‚Äôs Connections. Basically, when you solve it, the final purple category stays on the board and becomes the basis for a new Connections board. It‚Äôs kind of hard to explain in words, let me show you a diagram.

```
ACAI  STRAW     BLUE    BLACK,
DOWN  FISH      SUPER   LAUGH,
JET   LIQUORICE SOMBRE  MEAL,
RAVEN LOW       PUNCH   RITES
```

<br>
This gets solved into these categories:

**Last ___**
```
STRAW, MEAL, RITES, LAUGH
```
<br>

**Sad**
```
BLUE, DOWN, SOMBRE, LOW
```

<br>

**___ bowl**

```
ACAI, FISH, PUNCH, SUPER
```

<br>

**Dark shades**

```
BLACK, JET, RAVEN, LIQUORICE
```
  
<br>

Then the final category of BLACK, JET, RAVEN, LIQUORICE gets turned into a new board, where the four answers are distributed into new categories.

```
BLACK   JET       RAVEN   LIQUORICE
ROCKET  LASAGNA   EARTH   DRONE
CAKE    GREY      ONION   KIDNEY
MUNG    YOGHURT   SOY     CHILLI
```

<br>

Anyway, it‚Äôs really hard to make and quite challenging for the player. The first one I‚Äôve made has 10 levels, and I‚Äôve called it the All Purple challenge because it‚Äôs really hard, kind of like it‚Äôs all purple difficulty. Give it a go, it‚Äôs still in beta but I think it‚Äôs really fun.
