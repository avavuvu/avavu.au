  Sardonic interactive exhibit performed at Visual Diary in Brunswick. Participants would order from their phones from a fictional menu and the amount they ordered would affect what happens in the environment. I worked on tech, mainly on the website, with Adrian Frichitthavong who worked on Touch Designer.
