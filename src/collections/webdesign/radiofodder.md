Radio Fodder is the official radio station for the University of Melbourne. After several years of neglect, newfound enthusiasm for the station necessitated a new website. My design brief was to create something simple: minimal design outside the bare necessities of a radio station website. This extended to the fabric of the site, with references to CSS-less, naked HTML of Web 1.0, a style of web design sometimes described as [brutalist](https://brutalist-web.design/).

This is where the Times New Roman, two colour, left aligned design came from. The scrolling marquee is a reference to earlier web design, where untrained Geo Cities designers played slightly faster and slightly looser with the web. In fact, the ‘&lt;marquee>’ tag has since been removed from the HTML standard for accessibility concerns. I thought I would make the exception here. 

The website was coded in Vue, with a backend made in Python, using the Radiocult API and CMS.
