The goal of RMIT Digital Mediaâ€™s grad show website was to create something visually bold, that would match the art and design produced that year at RMIT. This project was made in collaboration with Adrian Frichitthavong, who designed the original layout. I was brought on board to optimise the website, and get a design working on mobile phones.

The project was made in React with Three.js.
