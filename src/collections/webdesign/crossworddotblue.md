Crossword Dot Blue is my spin on classic crosswords. Inspired by the New York Times, the website features artisanally crafted American style, Australian crosswords. Crosswords have the reputation of being impenetrably difficult. Especially early iterations of the website, I had play testers frustrated in a way that was not fun. The design of this website is a response to that frustration, an attempt to make the traditional crossword format more approachable for beginners. The colours of the site are bright, the with customisable themes to let players take ownership of their work.

The game design doesnâ€™t deviate too much from traditional American style crosswords, aside from the inclusion of word boundaries, as I found players incredibly frustrated with multi word answers. This was inspired by [Puzzmo](https://www.puzzmo.com), another website trying to get beginners into crosswords.

Puzzles on the website have become rarer, as I am now contributing crosswords to [Saturday Quiz Time.](https://www.saturdayquiztime.com.au/)

The website was made in Svelte, with Tailwind CSS, and a backend written in Firebase. To upload the crosswords to Firebase, I created a backend uploader written in Rust with Tauri.
